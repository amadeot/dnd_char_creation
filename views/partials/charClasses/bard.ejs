<p>Spellcasting: as a bard you have access to magic. You start by knowing two cantrips (of which you can cast as many times as you want) and four first level spells. Of the first level spells you know, you are able to cast two spells (either the same one twice, or two spells once) between each long rest. You use your charisma modifier as your spellcasting ability. You are able to cast any spell you know with the ritual tag as a ritual (casting a spell as a ritual takes ten minutes to cast, but does not use up one of your slots.) Your instrument is your spellcasting focus, and you need it to be able to cast spells. </p>

<p>You also gain the Bardic Inspiration ability, which you can use as a bonus action. It allows you to choose a creature that can hear you within 60 feet, and it gives that creature a Bardic Inspiration Die (six sided die). Within the next ten minutes, it can use that die once to add the number on it to an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. You can use this ability as many times as your Charisma modifier, and you regain uses of it after every long rest.</p>
