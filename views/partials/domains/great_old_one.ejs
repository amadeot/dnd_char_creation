<p>Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. It might come from the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be one of the elder gods known only in legends. Its motives are incomprehensible to mortals, and its knowledge so immense and ancient that even the greatest libraries pale in comparison to the vast secrets it holds. The Great Old One might be unaware of your existence
or entirely indifferent to you, but the secrets you have learned allow you to draw your magic from it.</p>

<p>Your patron gives you the abilty Awakened Mind: Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You can communicate telepathically with any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You donâ€™t need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.</p>
