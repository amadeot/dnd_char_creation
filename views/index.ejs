    <p>The fun of Dungeons and Dragons is how limitless it can be, but this is also what makes it so hard to start. This guide will attempt to help you create a first level character to play with, and know how to to do so. This guide will talk about a few attributes that will be introduced to you at first level that will scale as you play longer, but whenever possible anything past first level has been taken away. I have tried to pre-empt any questions you may have with explainations, but the fact is right now you're about to try to make a character without first reading the massive book(s) supposedly required to play. That's okay! You're going to learn by playing and it's going to be fun. That being said, you should most likely have a copy of the book on hand while you make a character to look up things in the glossary.</p>
    <p>Before we start, take a while and try to imagine the type of character you want to be in broad strokes. Maybe talk with someone who you are going to be playing with, or ask the person who will be running the game more about the background you are going to be stepping into. You can really be about anything, but I've done everything in my power to limit your choices here as much as possible to make it less overwhelming. Here is the order the guide is presented in, and you may find this helpful in thinking about creating a character. Please read the list fully, as decisions you want to make later might influence how you choose the beginning.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Step 1: Choose a race. There are 14 base races.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Dwarves: Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk. There are two types of dwarves: Hill Dwarves, and Mountain Dwarves. 
            <ul>
              <li>As a hill dwarf, you have keen senses, deep intuition, and remarkable resilience. You're from the foothills.</li>
              <li>As a mountain dwarf, you're strong and hardy, accustomed to a difficult life in rugged terrain. You're from inside a mountain.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Elves: Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world. There are three kinds of elves: High Elves, Wood Elves, and Dark Elves (Drow).
            <ul>
              <li>
                As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races. 
              </li>
              <li>
                As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests.
              </li>
              <li>
                Descended from an earlier subrace of elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Drow adventurers are rare, and the race does not exist in all worlds. Check with your Dungeon Master to see if you can play a drow character. They are also the only race that starts with a disadvantage, as direct sunlight makes it harder for them to see (though other things often make up for it).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Halflings: The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. There are two types of halflings, which are really more two clans than truly seperate races, Lightfoot Halflights, and Stout Halflings.
            <ul>
              <li>
                As a lightfoot halfling, you can easily hide from notice, even using other people as cover. You’re inclined to be affable and get along well with others. 
              </li>
              <li>
                As a stout halfling, you’re hardier than average and have some resistance to poison. Some say that stouts have dwarven blood.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though,they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, andgreat kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditionswith origins far beyond the reach of any single human’s memory.
          </li>
          <li>
            Born of dragons, as their name proclaims, the dragonborn walk proudly through a world that greets them with fearful incomprehension. Shaped by draconic gods or the dragons themselves, dragonborn originally hatched from dragon eggs as a unique race, combining the best attributes of dragons and humanoids. Some dragonborn are faithful servants to true dragons, others form the ranks of soldiers in great wars, and still others find themselves adrift, with no clear calling in life.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gnomes are diminuative creatures similar to halflings, but known more for their large clans living seperately from other races. A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close- knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play. There are two kinds of Gnomes: Forest Gnomes, and Rock Gnomes.
            <ul>
              <li>
                As a forest gnome, you have a natural knack for illusion and inherent quickness and stealth. In the worlds of D&D, forest gnomes are rare and secretive. They gather in hidden communities in sylvan forests, using illusions and trickery to conceal themselves from threats or to mask their escape should they be detected. Forest gnomes tend to be friendly with other good-spirited woodland folk, and they regard elves and good fey as their most important allies. These gnomes also befriend small forest animals and rely on them for information about threats that might prowl their lands.
              </li>
              <li>
                As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond that of other gnomes. Most gnomes in the worlds of D&D are rock gnomes.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing restless as they reach adulthood in the timeless elven realms, while their peers continue to live as children. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races. Many of these becom e adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, they still look human. However, their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle’s, and some spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns. They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors—black, red, white, silver, or gold—with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 2: Choose a class: Class is the primary definition of what your character can do. It’s more than a profession; it’s your character’s calling. Class shapes the way you think about theworld and interact with it and your relationship with other people and powers in the multiverse. A fighter,for example, might view the world in pragmatic termsof strategy and maneuvering, and see herself as just a pawn in a much larger game. A cleric, by contrast, might see himself as a willing servant in a god’s unfolding plan or a conflict brewing among various deities. While the fighter has contacts in a mercenary company or army, the cleric might know a number of priests, paladins, and devotees who share his faith. The classes are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Barbarian: A fierce warrior of primitive background who can enter a battle rage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bard: An inspiring magician whose power echoes the music of creation. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Cleric: A priestly champion who wields divine magic in service of a higher power.
          </li>
          <li>
            Druid: A priest of the Old Faith, wielding the powers of nature— moonlight and plant growth, fire and lightning— and adopting animal forms.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fighter: A master of martial combat, skilled with a variety of weapons and armor. If you choose, later on, you will have access to limited magic.
          </li>
          <li>
            Monk: A master of martial arts, harnessing the power of the body in pursuit of physical and spiritual perfection.
          </li>
          <li>
            Paladin: A holy warrior bound to a sacred oath. At higher levels they have access to magic.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ranger: A warrior who uses martial prowess and nature magic to combat threats on the edges of civilization. At higher levels they have access to magic.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rogue: A scoundrel who uses stealth and trickery to overcome obstacles and enemies. If you choose, later on, you will have access to limited magic.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sorcerer: A spellcaster who draws on inherent magic from a gift or bloodline.
          </li>
          <li>
            Warlock: A wielder of magic that is derived from a bargain with an extraplanar entity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Wizard: A scholarly magic-user capable of manipulating the structures of reality
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 3: Assign attribute scores. Think about which class you have chosen when assigning scores, and also know that your chosen race will also give bonuses to certain scores. Attributes are mostly important in terms by what their modifier is - your modifier for an attribute is the (attribute score - 10) / 2 rounded down. For example, if you had 15 strength, your strength modifier would be +2. This will affect many things, from your accuracy and damage delt swinging a sword, to your ability to jump. If you are a primary spellcaster, you should have at least a 16 in the ability you use to cast spells. If you are going to be a melee fighter, you want to have a high strength and constitution, and if you are going to be using bows and arrows, you want to make sure to have a high dexterity.
        The attributes are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Strength - The Strength score is a player’s measure of physical prowess and athletic ability. A player would use their Strength ability when asked to jump a chasm or move a heavy object. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Dexterity- The Dexterity score represents a player’s reflexes and agility. A player might use the Dexterity ability when trying to move undetected or pick a lock.
          </li>
          <li>
            Constitution- The Constitution score represents a player’s hardiness. A player could be asked to use the Constitution ability when resisting the effects of a poison or disease as well as to withstand the elements such as cold or heat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Intelligence- The Intelligence score is a measure or a character's knowledge about the world. Most players will use the Intelligence ability when they want to recall information about the world, like its history or religions.
          </li>
          <li>  
            Wisdom- The Wisdom score shows how attuned the player is to the world around them. A player will us the Wisdom ability to notice things in the environment or read a person’s body language and intentions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Charisma-The Charisma score measures a player’s ability to interact with people around. Players would use their Charisma when they wish to deceive or persuade someone.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 4: Describe your character. Think more about what motivates them, where they come from. Choose a background, and think of it as a starting point for the story of your character. Build on it, and have fun with it, as it will come up in the campaign. Different backgrounds will give you more equipment to start with, and different abilities that will help you later on. If you choose a background that grants you proficiency in a skill you already have chosen earlier, if possible go back and change the earlier skill so as to maximize how many skills you have. Choose a name and alignment. Your alignment is a base of how you will interact with the world, and consists of two axis. The first is good, neutral, and evil. The second is lawful, neutral, and chaotic. Combine these to choose your alignment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 5: You're done here! Take what you have to your dungeon master. Depending on the campaign, different equipment is going to be more or less common, and they may want you to start with a certain amount of gold to spend on it. Often going to a weapon and armor shop is one of the first parts of a campaign, so see how they want you to do this. After you've bought all your equipment, choose what armor you are going to use, and adjust your armor class to go with it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Step 6: Play!
