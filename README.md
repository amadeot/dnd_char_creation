# dnd_char_creation

I want someone who has never played dungeons and dragons before to have a tool which they can easily use as an on-ramp. I want them to be able to be told what's going on every step of the way without giving them too much overwhelming information at once. The process should be sipmple and easy, and at the end of it, they should know exactly what everything on their character sheet does, and be able to print it out.
