# dnd_char_creation


a user logs in and is prompted to to either create a new character or search for an existing one
when a user makes a new character, it is generated with a random string that the user can go to at “/:id”, the user is told to save this.
when they make a new character, they are given a small description of what the overall process of what that will entail. They will be told to think about what they want their character to be overall, with very basic descriptions of some of the options they will have.
They will be prompted to choose a race, with descriptions + skills of each.
Once they have chosen a race, there will be a simple character sheet below, that will be pre-populated with bonuses and abilities that are gained from choosing that race.
They will then be prompted to choose a class, with the same kind of descriptions  as a race would. If a class requires you to make more decisions upon choosing it, it allows you to do that.
It then continues populating the character sheet.
You then are prompted to roll dice for ability scores. You will then be shown the sheet, and can place the ability score rolls for each ability. The scores will be prepopulated with the bonuses you receive from the race chosen, and when a user places a score, it will be adjusted with the bonus automatically.
The user will then be prompted to think more about the details of this character - this section will be about description. They will be asked to choose an alignment, and background. They will have options / description of each.
